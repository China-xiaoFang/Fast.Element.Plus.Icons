- **Stay up-to-date with cutting-edge technology**: Adopt the latest technologies and frameworks to always stay abreast of the latest trends and developments in the industry.

### Background of the project

In the past, .NET did not have a good open source environment and community in China. As more and more programmers use .NET in China, the domestic open source environment and community are gradually getting better and better.

Various .NET open source frameworks have also emerged in response to the times.

As a newbie who has been working in the .NET industry for 5 years, I have also used many open source frameworks, so I want to make a small contribution to .NET open source based on my own work experience and experience.

So Fast.NET (v3) was born.

I would like to express my sincere thanks to the boss of the .NET open source framework.

It is precisely because of these .NET big guys that [Fast.NET](https://gitee.com/Net-18K/Fast.NET/tree/master/backend/Fast.NET) was born.

Special thanks to [Furion](https://gitee.com/dotnetchina/Furion) author [MonkSoul](https://gitee.com/monksoul).

[Fast.NET](https://gitee.com/Net-18K/Fast.NET) The underlying core code of the framework is provided by [Furion](https://gitee.com/dotnetchina/Furion), learn from or Part of the source code of [Furion v4](https://gitee.com/dotnetchina/Furion) is quoted, and the consent and authorization of the author [MonkSoul](https://gitee.com/monksoul) is also obtained.

**Continue to gather the strengths of hundreds of experts to improve and enrich the infrastructure of this framework, adding a choice to the .NET ecosystem!**
